# Environment Setup Guide for invite-user Function

## üö® Critical: Fix the "unexpected_failure" Error

The `invite-user` Edge Function is failing because of missing or incorrect environment variables. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Get Your Service Role Key

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Copy the **`service_role`** key (NOT the `anon` key)
   - It should be a long JWT token starting with `eyJ`
   - It should be different from your `anon` key

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Edge Function

1. In your **Supabase Dashboard**, go to **Edge Functions**
2. Click on the **`invite-user`** function
3. Go to the **Settings** tab
4. Add these environment variables:

### Required Variables:
```
SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... (your service role key)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... (your anon key)
```

### Optional Variables:
```
SITE_URL = https://your-domain.com (or http://localhost:5173 for development)
```

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Redeploy the Function

After setting the environment variables:
1. Click **Deploy** or **Redeploy** the function
2. Wait for deployment to complete

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test the Function

Try inviting a user again from your application. The function should now work correctly.

## üîç Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your setup:

- [ ] **Service Role Key is Set**: The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable is configured
- [ ] **Key is Correct Format**: The service role key starts with `eyJ` and is a long JWT token
- [ ] **Keys are Different**: The service role key is different from the anon key
- [ ] **Function is Deployed**: The Edge Function has been redeployed after setting variables
- [ ] **URL is Correct**: The `SUPABASE_URL` matches your project URL

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using Anon Key Instead of Service Role Key**
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Using the `anon` key for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Using the `service_role` key for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

2. **Not Redeploying After Setting Variables**
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Setting variables but not redeploying the function
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Always redeploy after changing environment variables

3. **Incorrect Variable Names**
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` or `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
