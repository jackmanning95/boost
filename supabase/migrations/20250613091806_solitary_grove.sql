  # Fix RLS infinite recursion by simplifying policies

  1. Problem
    - Current policies create circular dependencies between users and companies tables
    - Policies that join auth.users with users table cause infinite recursion
    - The query `users.select('*,companies(id,name)')` fails with recursion error

  2. Solution
    - Remove all policies that cause circular references
    - Create simple, direct policies using only auth.uid()
    - Avoid nested subqueries that reference the same tables
    - Use role information from JWT claims instead of database lookups where possible

  3. Security
    - Maintain proper access control
    - Users can only see their own data and company colleagues
    - Admins have broader access
    - No security compromises while fixing recursion
