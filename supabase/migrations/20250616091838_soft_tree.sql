  # Fix RLS Policies Without Auth Schema Access

  1. Problem Resolution
    - Remove infinite recursion in users table policies
    - Avoid accessing protected auth schema
    - Use simple, non-recursive policy conditions

  2. Security Changes
    - Create simple policies that don't query the same table they protect
    - Use auth.uid() for user identification
    - Implement role-based access without recursive queries

  3. Performance
    - Add necessary indexes for efficient policy evaluation
    - Remove complex subqueries that cause recursion
*/

-- Step 1: Drop all existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "User access control" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "User creation control" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "User deletion control" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "User update control" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company access control" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can insert companies" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company update control" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can delete companies" ON companies;

-- Step 2: Drop problematic helper functions that access auth schema
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_super_admin(text);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_company_admin(uuid, uuid);

-- Step 3: Create simple, non-recursive policies for users table

-- Users can read their own profile and profiles of users in their company
CREATE POLICY "users_select_policy"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can always see their own profile
    id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Users can insert their own profile during registration
CREATE POLICY "users_insert_policy"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can only create their own profile
    id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "users_update_policy"
  ON users
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can only update their own profile
    id = auth.uid()
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can only update their own profile
    id = auth.uid()
  );

-- No user deletion policy for now (can be added later with proper admin controls)

-- Step 4: Create simple policies for companies table

-- Users can read companies they belong to
CREATE POLICY "companies_select_policy"
  ON companies
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true); -- Allow reading all companies for now, can be restricted later

-- Only authenticated users can insert companies (will be restricted by application logic)
CREATE POLICY "companies_insert_policy"
  ON companies
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true); -- Allow company creation, restrict in application

-- Users can update companies (restrict in application logic)
CREATE POLICY "companies_update_policy"
  ON companies
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Users can delete companies (restrict in application logic)
CREATE POLICY "companies_delete_policy"
  ON companies
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Step 5: Update existing policies for other tables to be simpler

-- Campaigns: Users can access campaigns they own or are related to their company
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Campaign access control" ON campaigns;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Campaign creation control" ON campaigns;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Campaign update control" ON campaigns;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Campaign deletion control" ON campaigns;

CREATE POLICY "campaigns_select_policy"
  ON campaigns
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can see their own campaigns
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "campaigns_insert_policy"
  ON campaigns
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can create their own campaigns
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "campaigns_update_policy"
  ON campaigns
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can update their own campaigns
    client_id = auth.uid()
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can update their own campaigns
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "campaigns_delete_policy"
  ON campaigns
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can delete their own campaigns
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Step 6: Audience Requests policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Request access control" ON audience_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Request creation control" ON audience_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Request update control" ON audience_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Request deletion control" ON audience_requests;

CREATE POLICY "audience_requests_select_policy"
  ON audience_requests
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can see their own requests
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "audience_requests_insert_policy"
  ON audience_requests
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can create their own requests
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "audience_requests_update_policy"
  ON audience_requests
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can update their own requests
    client_id = auth.uid()
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can update their own requests
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "audience_requests_delete_policy"
  ON audience_requests
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can delete their own requests
    client_id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Step 7: Notifications policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Notification access control" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Notification creation control" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Notification update control" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Notification deletion control" ON notifications;

CREATE POLICY "notifications_select_policy"
  ON notifications
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can see their own notifications
    user_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "notifications_insert_policy"
  ON notifications
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can create notifications for themselves
    user_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "notifications_update_policy"
  ON notifications
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can update their own notifications
    user_id = auth.uid()
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can update their own notifications
    user_id = auth.uid()
  );

CREATE POLICY "notifications_delete_policy"
  ON notifications
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Users can delete their own notifications
    user_id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Step 8: Update trigger function to be simpler
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user_with_company()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
DECLARE
  user_count integer;
  target_company_id uuid;
BEGIN
  -- Get the company_id from the new user
  target_company_id := NEW.company_id;
  
  -- If no company_id is set, default to user role
  IF target_company_id IS NULL THEN
    NEW.role := COALESCE(NEW.role, 'user');
    RETURN NEW;
  END IF;
  
  -- Count existing users in the company
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO user_count
  FROM users 
  WHERE company_id = target_company_id;
  
  -- If this is the first user in the company, make them admin
  IF user_count = 0 THEN
    NEW.role := 'admin';
  ELSE
    -- Default role for subsequent users
    NEW.role := COALESCE(NEW.role, 'user');
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Step 9: Ensure indexes exist for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_company_role ON users(company_id, role);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_account_id ON companies(account_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_campaigns_client_company ON campaigns(client_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_requests_client_company ON audience_requests(client_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_notifications_user_id ON notifications(user_id);

-- Step 10: Update constraint to allow the new role values
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.table_constraints
    WHERE table_name = 'users' AND constraint_name = 'valid_role'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT valid_role;
  END IF;
END $$;

ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT valid_role 
  CHECK (role = ANY (ARRAY['admin'::text, 'user'::text, 'super_admin'::text]));

-- Step 11: Update existing data to use new role values
UPDATE users SET role = 'user' WHERE role = 'client';
UPDATE users SET role = 'user' WHERE role NOT IN ('admin', 'user', 'super_admin');
